We are continuing to grow and we’re looking for a Technical Lead to join the team. We’re happy to consider applicants anywhere in New Zealand for this role, but being based in Auckland or Wellington would be a bonus.</p> <h2>The Work</h2> <p>You’ll be part of our Product &amp; Automation team working alongside our Head of Product and Technical Director to help make technical design and architecture decisions as well as driving technical excellence within the team. This will involve a mixture of mentoring other team members, R&amp;D projects to scope work and working hands on to ship high quality code/features.</p> <p>This is an opportunity to really help shape products and people as the team will be looking to you to provide guidance, being a sounding board for complex decisions and generally provide leadership and guidance.\\xa0</p> <h2>About You</h2> <p>To be effective in this role you’ll need to have a deep knowledge of various technologies, infrastructure and workflows. You should be a kind and empathetic person that enjoys mentoring and guiding others to see them grow and achieve their goals. You know great communication skills are just as important as your technical abilities.</p> <p>You’ll have informed opinions on how to go about building systems based on your experience, but equally you are ready to adapt if a different but valid solution is presented. You’ll also be someone that thrives on taking ownership of projects and delivering. We imagine this role will have close to a 50/50 split between hands on programming and management related tasks.</p> <h2>The Stack</h2> <p>We are responsible for a variety of products and brands so our stack is quite varied. For our new product you can expect to find Go, C and React built on various cloud services. For our legacy products you’ll primarily find PHP and Python, but don’t be surprised to find other tech around the place. From an infrastructure perspective you’ll be using our colocated systems, as well as AWS (and others) via tools like Terraform, Serverless Framework and Docker.</p> <p>We’re focused on shipping code that is maintainable, performant, stable and secure. Following trends and being on the bleeding edge is not a measure of success for us.\\xa0</p> <h2>Working at SiteHost</h2> <p>We like to think SiteHost is a great place to work. We’re a friendly team that enjoys having fun while getting things done. We support flexible working arrangements and encourage a healthy work-life balance. As any growing company does, we have challenges to overcome but we approach those with care. You can expect us to be supportive, flexible and fair and we’ll expect you to take initiative, step up to a challenge and pursue personal growth in a healthy way.</p> <h2>How to Apply</h2> <p>Interested?
